BiblionChain comes from the Greek word *biblíon*, meaning “book,” and the concept of information being stored "on chain," i.e. on a blockchain where it resides in an immutable, distributed ledger that's resistant to tampering.

*This was a quick project to practice web3 / smart contract development. Not currently intended for public use. Plan to update contract in the near future with lessons learned from more recent Solidity courses/lessons/practice. *
